.# Abstract

This document defines a profile intended for instant messaging interoperability
of messages end-to-end encrypted inside the MLS (Message Layer Security)
Protocol. It adapts prior work (CPIM) to work well in the MLS context.

# Terminology
The terms MLS client, MLS group, ...

# Motivation

MLS [@!I-D.ietf-mls-protocol] is a group key establishment protocol 
motivated by the desire for group chat with efficient end-to-end encryption. 
While one of the motivations of MLS is interoperable standards-based secure
messaging, the MLS protocol does not define or prescribe any format for the
encrypted "application messages" encoded by MLS.  The development of MLS 
was strongly motivated by the needs of a number of Instant Messaging (IM) 
systems, which encrypt messages end-to-end using variations of the 
Double Ratchet protocol []. 

End-to-end encrypted instant messaging was also a motivator for the Common
Protocol for Instant Messaging (CPIM) [@!RFC3862], however the model used at the time
assumed standalone encryption of each message using a protocol such as S/MIME
[@?RFC8551] or PGP [@?RFC3156] to interoperate between IM protocols such as
SIP [@?RFC3261] and XMPP [@?RFC6120].  For a variety of practical reasons, interoperable
end-to-end encryption between IM systems was never deployed commercially.

There are now several vendors prepared to implement MLS. In order to enable
interoperable messaging conveyed "inside" MLS application messages, some 
additional specification and some minor changes are required. Also, the 
expectation of what constitutes basic features common across multiple IM
systems has grown. It would be beneficial to provide an interoperable format
for these additional features as well.  Most of these features can be 
implemented using a profile which describes how to use already-defined
URIs, message headers, and MIME types. 

This proposal assumes that MLS clients can advertise MIME types they support
and that MLS clients can determine what MIME types of required to join a
specific MLS group. A companion proposal defines two MLS extensions which
meets this requirement. It would allow implementations to define groups
with different MIME type requirements and it would allow MLS clients to send
extended or proprietary messages that would be interpreted by some members
of the group while assuring that an interoperable end-to-end encrypted
baseline is available to all members, even when the group spans multiple
systems or vendors.

Below is a list of some features commonly found in IM group chat systems:

* plain text and rich text messaging
* delivery notifications
* read receipts
* replies
* reactions
* edit or delete previously sent messages
* expiring messages
* knock / ping
* hide messages
* shared files/audio/videos
* calling / conferencing

# Overview

This proposal relies on

URIs for naming and identifiers

Types of identifiers
group chat conversation identifier
handle identifier
user identifier
MLS client identifier

One user may have multiple clients (for example a mobile and a desktop client)

Negotiation of MIME types


Specific Message headers

Specific usage of MIME header


We assume that an MLS group is already established and that either out-of-band
or using the MLS protocol or MLS extensions that the following is known to every
member of the group:

* The membership of the group (via MLS).
* The identity of any MLS client which sends an application message (via MLS).
* The MLS group ID (via MLS)
* The human readable name(s) of the MLS group, if any (out-of-band or extension).
* Which MIME types are mandatory to implement (proposed extension).
* For each member, the MIME types each supports (proposed extension).

For all messages the message header equivalent of To and Sender fields is already
known and is therefore redundant. Every message contains a message/cpim header which 
includes the From, DateTime, and Message-ID fields.

Messages send to an MLS group are delivered to every member of the group active during
the epoch in which the message was sent.


 
# Example
## Original Message

In this example, Alice Smith sends a rich-text (Markdown) [@!RFC7763]
message to the Engineering Team MLS group. The following values are
implied as if headers were present:

* Implied Sender header from MLS sender:
  <im:3b52249d-68f9-45ce-8bf5-c799f3cad7ec-0003@example.com>
* Implied To header from MLS group: "Engineering Team" 
  <im:9dc867ca-3a01-4385-bb69-1573601c3c0c@example.com>

Hi everyone, we just shipped release 2.0. __Good work__!

## Reply

A reply message looks similar, but contains an In-Reply-To CPIM header with
the ID of the original message. The implied To header is the same all 
example messages in this section. The implied Sender header is always the
MLS sender, and will not be shown in subsequent example messages.

## Reaction 

A reaction, uses the reaction Content-Disposition token defined in [@RFC9078]. 
This Content-Disposition token indicates that the intended disposition of the
contents of the message is a reaction. 

The content in the sample message is a single Unicode heart character (U+2665).
Discovering the range of characters each implementation could render as a
reaction can occur out-of-band and is not within the scope of this proposal. 
However, an implementation which receives a reaction character string it 
does not recognize could render the reaction as a reply, possibly prefixing
with a localized string such as "Reaction: ".  Note that a reaction could
theoretically even be another media type (ex: image, audio, or video), although
not currently implemented in major instant messaging systems.

## Mentions

In instant messaging systems and social media, a mention allows special
formatting and behavior when a name, handle, or tag associated with a
known group is encountered, often when prefixed with a commercial-at "@"
character for mentions of users or a hash "#" character for groups or tags.
A message which contains a mention may trigger distinct notifications on 
the IM client. 

We can convey a mention by linking the user, handle, or tag URI in Markdown
or HTML rich content. For example, a mention using Markdown is indicated below.

## Edit

Unlike with email messages, it is common in IM systems to allow the sender of
a message to edit or delete the message after the fact. Typically the message
is replaced in the user interface of the receivers (even after the original 
message is read) but shows a visual indication that it has been edited. 

We reuse the Supersedes header from MIXER [@!RFC2156], because the semantics
are correct: the message included in the body is a replacement for the message
with the superseded message ID.

Here Bob Jones corrects a typo in his original message:

~~~~~~~
Content-type: message/cpim

From: <im:bob-jones@example.com>
DateTime: 2022-02-08T22:13:57-00:00
Message-ID: <89d3472622a4@example.com>
Supersedes: <e701beee59f9@example.com>

Content-Type: text/markdown;charset=utf-8

Right on! _Congratulations_ y'all!
~~~~~~~

## Delete

In IM systems, a delete means that the author of a specific message has 
retracted the message, regardless if other users have read the message
or not. Typically a placeholder remains in the user interface showing
that a message was deleted. Replies which reference a deleted message
typically hide the quoted portion and reflect that the original message
was deleted.

If Bob deleted his message instead of modifying it, we would represent it
using the Supersedes header with an empty body, as shown below.

~~~~~~~
Content-type: message/cpim

From: <im:bob-jones@example.com>
DateTime: 2022-02-08T22:13:57-00:00
Message-ID: <89d3472622a4@example.com>
Supersedes: <e701beee59f9@example.com>

Content-Length: 0
~~~~~~~

## Expiring

Expiring messages are designed to be deleted automatically by the receiving
client at a certain time whether they have been read or not.  As with manually
deleted messages, there is no guarantee that a uncooperative client or a
determined user will not save the content of the message, however most clients
respect the convention.

MIXER defines an Expires header which is also used
 sent simply by including an Expires header in the CPIM message body.  
 
To avoid using two different date header syntaxes, we define an 
ExpiresDateTime header, which uses the same date/time format as 
CPIM's DateTime header. The semantics of the header are that the message
is automatically deleted by the receiving clients at the indicated time
without user interaction or network connectivity necessary.

## Knock

A knock or ping is message sent to get the attention of a user or a
group of users.  It might be sent when a user has not responded to 
direct messages or mentions, or in a group when something requires 
the attention of everyone quickly (ex: a serious unusual situation
like a major system outage). 

We represent a knock as a text/plain body containing a single CRLF
with the alert Content-Disposition token (defined in [@!RFC3261]).

DateTime: 2022-02-08T22:13:45-00:00
Message-ID: <c1a3375bfe3f@example.com>

Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Disposition: alert


~~~~~~~

## Read Receipt

In instant messaging systems, read receipts typically generate a distinct
indicator for each message. In some systems, the number of users in a group
who have read the message is subtly displayed and the list of users who
read the message is available on further inspection.

Of course, Internet mail has support for read receipts as well, but 
the existing message disposition notification mechanism defined for email
in [@?RFC8098] is unfortunately inappropriate in this context.

* notifications can be sent by intermediaries
* only one notification can be sent about a single message per recipient
* a human-readable version of the notification is expected
* each notification can refer to only one message
* it is extremely verbose

The proposed format below, message/immi-disposition-notification is sent
by one member of an MLS group to the entire group and can refer to multiple messages. There
is one IMMI-Disposition line per message, with the disposition of the original 
message in a parameter. As the disposition at the recipient changes, it can be
updated in a subsequent notification.
