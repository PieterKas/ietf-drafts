.# Abstract

This document defines a profile intended for instant messaging interoperability
of messages end-to-end encrypted inside the MLS (Message Layer Security)
Protocol. It adapts prior work (CPIM) to work well in the MLS context.

{mainmatter}

# Terminology
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to
be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [@!RFC2219].

The terms MLS client, MLS group, and KeyPackage have the same meanings as in
the MLS protocol [@!I-D.ietf-mls-protocol].

# Introduction

MLS [@!I-D.ietf-mls-protocol] is a group key establishment protocol
motivated by the desire for group chat with efficient end-to-end encryption.
While one of the motivations of MLS is interoperable standards-based secure
messaging, the MLS protocol does not define or prescribe any format for the
encrypted "application messages" encoded by MLS.  The development of MLS
was strongly motivated by the needs of a number of Instant Messaging (IM)
systems, which encrypt messages end-to-end using variations of the
Double Ratchet protocol [].

End-to-end encrypted instant messaging was also a motivator for the Common
Protocol for Instant Messaging (CPIM) [@!RFC3862], however the model used at the time
assumed standalone encryption of each message using a protocol such as S/MIME
[@?RFC8551] or PGP [@?RFC3156] to interoperate between IM protocols such as
SIP [@?RFC3261] and XMPP [@?RFC6120].  For a variety of practical reasons, interoperable
end-to-end encryption between IM systems was never deployed commercially.

There are now several vendors prepared to implement MLS. In order to enable
interoperable messaging conveyed "inside" MLS application messages, some
additional specification and some minor changes are required. Also, the
expectation of what constitutes basic features common across multiple IM
systems has grown. It would be beneficial to provide an interoperable format
for these additional features as well.  Most of these features can be
implemented using a profile which describes how to use already-defined
URIs, message headers, and MIME types.

This proposal assumes that MLS clients can advertise MIME types they support
and that MLS clients can determine what MIME types are required to join a
specific MLS group. A companion proposal
[@!I-D.mahy-dispatch-immi-mls-mime] defines two MLS extensions which
meets this requirement. It would allow implementations to define groups
with different MIME type requirements and it would allow MLS clients to send
extended or proprietary messages that would be interpreted by some members
of the group while assuring that an interoperable end-to-end encrypted
baseline is available to all members, even when the group spans multiple
systems or vendors.

Below is a list of some features commonly found in IM group chat systems:

* plain text and rich text messaging
* delivery notifications
* read receipts
* replies
* reactions
* edit or delete previously sent messages
* expiring messages
* knock / ping
* shared files/audio/videos
* calling / conferencing

# Overview

## Naming schemes

IM systems have a number of types of identifiers. Not all systems use
every type:

* client/device identifier (internal representation)
* user identifier
* handle identifier (external, friendly representation)
* group conversation identifier
* group or or channel name (external, friendly representation)
* team identifier (less common)

One user may have multiple clients (for example a mobile and a desktop client).
A handle may refer to a single user or it may redirect to multiple users.
In some systems, the user identifier is a handle. In other systems the user
identifier is an internal representation, for example a UUID. Handles may be
changed/renamed, but hopefully internal user identifiers do not.
Unqualified handles are often prefixed with a commercial at-sign ("@").

Likewise, group conversation identifiers could be internal or external
representations, whereas group names or channel names are often external
friendly representations.  Unqualified channel names are often prefixed
with a hash character ("#"). Some systems have an additional level of hierarchy
with a team identifier under which groups/channels can be organized and
authorized.

This proposal relies on URIs for naming and identifiers. All the example use
the `im:` URI scheme (defined in [@!RFC3862]), but any instant messaging scheme
is acceptable.

## Negotiation of MIME types

As most IM systems are proprietary, standalone systems, it is useful to allow
clients to send and receive proprietary formats among themselves. Using the
multipart/alternative MIME wrapper, clients can send a message using the basic
functionality described in this document AND a proprietary format for
same-vendor clients simultaneously over the same group with end-to-end
encryption.

[@!I-D.mahy-dispatch-immi-mls-mime] contains the actual MLS extensions useful for negotiating
MIME types. The profile in this document requires support for receiving message/cpim,
text/plain, text/markdown, and multipart MIME. All other mime types (including
some recommended in this profile) are optional.

Example sending this profile and proprietary messaging protocol simultaneously.

Content-type: multipart/alternative

## CPIM and MIME headers

We assume that an MLS group is already established and that either out-of-band
or using the MLS protocol or MLS extensions that the following is known to every
member of the group:

* The membership of the group (via MLS).
* The identity of any MLS client which sends an application message (via MLS).
* The MLS group ID (via MLS)
* The human readable name(s) of the MLS group, if any (out-of-band or extension).
* Which MIME types are mandatory to implement (proposed extension).
* For each member, the MIME types each supports (proposed extension).

For all messages the message header equivalent of To (the MLS group) and
Sender fields (MLS sender) is already
known and is therefore redundant. Every message contains a message/cpim header which
includes the From, DateTime, and Message-ID fields. The From field contains the
external, user-friendly representation of the Sender.

Messages sent to an MLS group are delivered to every member of the group active during
the epoch in which the message was sent.

It is also mandatory to understand are the following MIME headers:

* Content-Type
* Content-Disposition
* Content-Length


# Example
## Original Message

In this example, Alice Smith sends a rich-text (Markdown) [@!RFC7763]
message to the Engineering Team MLS group. The following values are
implied as if headers were present:

* Implied Sender header from MLS sender:
  <im:3b52249d-68f9-45ce-8bf5-c799f3cad7ec-0003@example.com>
* Implied To header from MLS group: "Engineering Team"
  <im:9dc867ca-3a01-4385-bb69-1573601c3c0c@example.com>

Hi everyone, we just shipped release 2.0. __Good work__!
~~~~~~~


## Reply

A reply message looks similar, but contains an In-Reply-To CPIM header with
the ID of the original message. The implied To header is the same all
example messages in this section. The implied Sender header is always the
MLS sender, and will not be shown in subsequent example messages.

In-Reply-To: <28fd19857ad7@example.com>

Content-Type: text/markdown;charset=utf-8

Right on! _Congratulations_ 'all!
~~~~~~~

## Reaction

A reaction, uses the reaction Content-Disposition token defined in [@RFC9078].
This Content-Disposition token indicates that the intended disposition of the
contents of the message is a reaction.

The content in the sample message is a single Unicode heart character (U+2665).
Discovering the range of characters each implementation could render as a
reaction can occur out-of-band and is not within the scope of this proposal.
However, an implementation which receives a reaction character string it
does not recognize could render the reaction as a reply, possibly prefixing
with a localized string such as "Reaction: ".  Note that a reaction could
theoretically even be another media type (ex: image, audio, or video), although
not currently implemented in major instant messaging systems.

## Mentions

In instant messaging systems and social media, a mention allows special
formatting and behavior when a name, handle, or tag associated with a
known group is encountered, often when prefixed with a commercial-at "@"
character for mentions of users or a hash "#" character for groups or tags.
A message which contains a mention may trigger distinct notifications on
the IM client.

We can convey a mention by linking the user, handle, or tag URI in Markdown
or HTML rich content. For example, a mention using Markdown is indicated below.

## Edit

Unlike with email messages, it is common in IM systems to allow the sender of
a message to edit or delete the message after the fact. Typically the message
is replaced in the user interface of the receivers (even after the original
message is read) but shows a visual indication that it has been edited.

We reuse the Supersedes header from MIXER [@!RFC2156], because the semantics
are correct: the message included in the body is a replacement for the message
with the superseded message ID.

Here Bob Jones corrects a typo in his original message:

~~~~~~~
Content-type: message/cpim

From: <im:bob-jones@example.com>
DateTime: 2022-02-08T22:13:57-00:00
Message-ID: <89d3472622a4@example.com>
Supersedes: <e701beee59f9@example.com>

Content-Type: text/markdown;charset=utf-8

Right on! _Congratulations_ y'all!
~~~~~~~

## Delete

In IM systems, a delete means that the author of a specific message has
retracted the message, regardless if other users have read the message
or not. Typically a placeholder remains in the user interface showing
that a message was deleted. Replies which reference a deleted message
typically hide the quoted portion and reflect that the original message
was deleted.

If Bob deleted his message instead of modifying it, we would represent it
using the Supersedes header with an empty body, as shown below.

~~~~~~~
Content-type: message/cpim

From: <im:bob-jones@example.com>
DateTime: 2022-02-08T22:13:57-00:00
Message-ID: <89d3472622a4@example.com>
Supersedes: <e701beee59f9@example.com>

Content-Length: 0
~~~~~~~

## Expiring

Expiring messages are designed to be deleted automatically by the receiving
client at a certain time whether they have been read or not.  As with manually
deleted messages, there is no guarantee that a uncooperative client or a
determined user will not save the content of the message, however most clients
respect the convention.

MIXER defines an Expires header which is also used
 sent simply by including an Expires header in the CPIM message body.

To avoid using two different date header syntaxes, we define an
ExpiresDateTime header, which uses the same date/time format as
CPIM's DateTime header. The semantics of the header are that the message
is automatically deleted by the receiving clients at the indicated time
without user interaction or network connectivity necessary.

## Knock

A knock or ping is message sent to get the attention of a user or a
group of users.  It might be sent when a user has not responded to
direct messages or mentions, or in a group when something requires
the attention of everyone quickly (ex: a serious unusual situation
like a major system outage).

We represent a knock as a text/plain body containing a single CRLF
with the alert Content-Disposition token (defined in [@!RFC3261]).

~~~~~~~
Content-type: message/cpim

From: <im:alice-smith@example.com>
DateTime: 2022-02-08T22:13:45-00:00
Message-ID: <c1a3375bfe3f@example.com>

Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Disposition: alert


~~~~~~~

## Read Receipt

In instant messaging systems, read receipts typically generate a distinct
indicator for each message. In some systems, the number of users in a group
who have read the message is subtly displayed and the list of users who
read the message is available on further inspection.

Of course, Internet mail has support for read receipts as well, but
the existing message disposition notification mechanism defined for email
in [@?RFC8098] is unfortunately inappropriate in this context.

* notifications can be sent by intermediaries
* only one notification can be sent about a single message per recipient
* a human-readable version of the notification is expected
* each notification can refer to only one message
* it is extremely verbose

The proposed format below, message/immi-disposition-notification is sent
by one member of an MLS group to the entire group and can refer to multiple messages. There
is one IMMI-Disposition line per message, with the disposition of the original
message in a parameter. As the disposition at the recipient changes, the disposition
can be updated in a subsequent notification.

~~~~~~~
Content-type: message/cpim

From: <im:bob-jones@example.com>
DateTime: 2022-02-09T07:57:13-00:00
Message-ID: <7e924c2e6ee5@example.com>

Content-Disposition: notification
Content-type: message/immi-disposition-notification

IMMI-Disposition: <4dcab7711a77@example.com>;dispo=read
IMMI-Disposition: <285f75c46430@example.com>;dispo=read
IMMI-Disposition: <c5e0cd6140e6@example.com>;dispo=read
IMMI-Disposition: <5c95a4dfddab@example.com>;dispo=expired
~~~~~~~


## Attachments

The message/external-body MIME Type is a convenient way to present a
URL to download an attachment which should not be rendered inline.

~~~~~~~
Content-Type: message/external-body; access-type="URL";
 URL="https://example.com/storage/bigfile.m4v";
 size=708234961
~~~~~~~


## Conferencing

Joining a conference via URL is also possible. The link could be
rendered to the user, requiring a click. Alternatively another
Content-Disposition could be specified to more automatic actions.
However further calling and conferencing functionality is out-of-scope
of this document.

~~~~~~~
Content-Type: message/external-body; access-type="URL";
 URL="https://example.com/join/12345"

# IMMI CPIM profile

We define a profile of CPIM for instant messaging within MLS.
The grammar uses Augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) [@!RFC5234].

## CPIM headers

The following CPIM headers are required:

* From: the identity of message sender. for example im:alice@example.com
  this identity could be pseudonymous or anonymous if the group policy allows.
* DateTime: the date and time in a reasonable format, as specified in CPIM.
* Message-ID: a message ID which is unique across domains.
* Content-type: As is from CPIM.
* In-Reply-To: Refers to the previous Message-ID. Same semantics as in
 [@?RFC5322].
* Supersedes: Refers to the previous Messsage-ID. Similar semantics to
  header of the same name in MIXER.
  Content-Disposition:  The intended handling of the message. The two required
  dispositions are render and reaction.
* Content-Length:

For clarity the grammar for the headers not already included in CPIM are
formulated below.

~~~~~~~
msg-id-header-line = msg-id-header ":" SP msg-id CRLF
msg-id-header = "Message-ID"   ; case-sensitive

in-reply-to-header-line = in-reply-to-header ":" SP msg-id CRLF
in-reply-to-header = "In-Reply-To"   ; case-sensitive

supersedes-header-line = supersedes-header ":" SP msg-id CRLF
supersedes-header = "Supersedes"   ; case-sensitive


msg-id = "<" id-left "@" id-right ">"

id-left  = dot-atom-text
id-right = dot-atom-text / no-fold-literal

dot-atom-text   =   1*atext *("." 1*atext)

atext = ALPHA / DIGIT / atom-symbol

atom-symbol = "!" / "#" / "$" / "%" / "&" / "'" / "*" / "+" / "-" /
              "/" / "=" / "?" / "^" / "_" / "`" / "{" / "|" / "}" / "~"

no-fold-literal = "[" *dtext "]"

dtext = %d33-90 / %d94-126 ; Printable US-ASCII
                           ; excluding "[", "]", and "\"
~~~~~~~



## Definition of message/immi-disposition-notification

The grammar below defines the syntax.

~~~~~~~
immi-disposition-notification-body = 1*immi-header-line

immi-header-line = immi-header ":" SP msg-id ";" status CRLF

imm-header = "IMMI-Disposition" ; case-sensitive

status = "dispo" "=" status-value

status-value = "read" /
               "error" /
               "delivered" /
               "expired" /
               "deleted" /
               "hidden"
~~~~~~~

## Required and Recommended MIME types

The following MIME types are REQUIRED:

* message/cpim
* multipart/alternative
* multipart/mixed
* multipart/parallel
* text/plain
* text/markdown

The following MIME types are RECOMMENDED:

* text/html
* message/external-body
* message/immi-disposition-notification
* image/jpeg
* image/png
